# Hoodoo Digital QA Automation Challenge
Thanks for considering joining us at Hoodoo Digital! This is a challenge that will help us better understand your skills as an automation engineer.

## Instructions
Develop tests for these two problems using a test automation framework of your choice. If you need some inspiration, two frameworks we use at Hoodoo are Selenium WebDriver (Java) and WebdriverIO (node.js).

Implement a simple version of the framework that can run in Chrome browser (headless or the real browser, that is up to you).

Include a README detailing your thought process and answering these questions:
- Which framework did you select and why?
- How is your code structured?
- Did you face any difficulties in implementing these tests?
- Is there anything you would have done differently if you had more time?

This challenge is intended to take a couple of hours. Please consider that as you work through this, and detail anything you didn’t have time to finish in your README report.

### Part 1
Write a test that checks that “http” redirects to “https” for the hoodoo.digital homepage.

- http://hoodoo.digital should redirect to https://hoodoo.digital


### Part 2
Write a test that checks that “Our Services” is a section on the Hoodoo Digital homepage, and that the Our Services section contains a blurb titled “Adobe Experience Manager.”


## Your submission
Please submit the code to your solution as a Github or Gitlab link and send us a link to your repo. If you prefer to keep the repository private, send an email letting us know and invite your interviewer to the private repository.
